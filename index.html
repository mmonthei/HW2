			<h2> About Me </h2>
			
			<div class="centerText">
			
			<p> Hi! My name is McKayla Monthei and I am a senior at the University of Iowa. 
			I am from small town Jewell, Iowa. I have two brothers, Zachary and Jesse. This picture was taken about 2 years ago during a 
			family Christmas at my brother Zach's house. My oldest brother Zach is 8 years older than me. Jesse is about 5 years older than me.
			Family is very important to me. Since most of my cousins have grown up and started their own families, it gets more difficult to 
			organize family gatherings. We make sure to get together on all of the major holidays. When we do get together, it is a full house.
			</p>

			<p> I decided to go to the University of Iowa because it is just far enough away from home that I felt independent,
			but close enough that I could go home on a weekend. It is about a 2 and a half hour drive to my hometown. I also loved the campus.
			My brother Jesse is in Pharmacy school at the University of Iowa, so when my parents and I would come to see him we would take tours of campus.
			My family is full of Cyclone fans, but now that my brother and I both go to Iowa, my parents will now where Hawkeye apparel occasionally.
