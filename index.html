			<h2> About Me </h2>
			
			<div class="centerText">
			
			<p> Hi! My name is McKayla Monthei and I am a senior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems.
			My focus is in the Business Analytics track, but I have taken courses on the Information Systems track that I have enjoyed.
			</p>
			
			<p>I am from small town Jewell, Iowa. I have two brothers, Zachary and Jesse. The picture below was taken about 2 years ago during a 
			family Christmas at my brother Zach's house. My oldest brother Zach is 8 years older than me and has three boys. Jesse is about 5 years older than me.
			Family is very important to me. Since most of my cousins have grown up and started their own families, it gets more difficult to 
			organize family gatherings. We make sure to get together on all of the major holidays. When we do get together, it is a full house.
			</p>

			<p> I decided to go to the University of Iowa because it is just far enough away from home that I felt independent,
			but close enough that I could go home on a weekend. It is about a 2 and a half hour drive to my hometown. I also loved the campus.
			My brother Jesse is in Pharmacy school at the University of Iowa, so when my parents and I would come to see him we would take tours of campus.
			My family is full of Cyclone fans, but now that my brother and I both go to Iowa, my parents will now wear Hawkeye apparel occasionally. My mom went to college
			at Iowa for a little bit and my parents both lived in Iowa City for a while. My mom will wear Iowa gear willingly, but my dad took a while. My dad's favorite
			jacket is an Iowa Pharmacy jacket that my brother Jesse bought him for his birthday. 
			</p>

			<p> I will graduate after being at Iowa for only 3 years. This last semester has already gone by fast. When I graduate in May, I have a job lined up at RSM in 
			Des Moines. I will be working with their IT Vision program. I am very excited for this opportunity. All of the skills I have gained through school in the last 
			three years have helped in the job selection process. 
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p> Not only has my schooling helped me in the job selection process, but also my work experience. I have held many positions, a few are: </p>
			<ul>
			<li> ITS Help Desk Student Consultant and Team Lead at the University of Iowa
			<li> Receptionist at Electronic Engineering in Ames, IA
			<li> Point of Sales at Pizza Ranch in Story City, IA
			</ul>
